# Dotfiles [![CI](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nahueespinosa/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/build.yml)

These are the configuration files and plugins that I use for command-line programs.
I **do not recommend** installing them unless you're willing to overwrite the dotfiles on your machine. However, feel free to copy whatever you want.
